Regarding the Symbolset Font:

This version of The Personal Page makes use of Symbolset (http://symbolset.com). 

Symbolsets are semantic symbol fonts. They work in modern browsers and anywhere OpenType features are supported.

The use of Symbolset's fonts is governed by their product license, which can be found here: http://symbolset.com/license/

If you intend to use Symbolset fonts in your own iteration of The Personal Page, you must purchase your own license from http://symbolset.com. They're quite affordable, and are well worth the money.

The font files themselves have not been uploaded here. You'll see them referenced in the code.
